### New Knowledgebase
Eight months ago, we silently started accepting orders and arranging offers with clients. During this time, we were using the Knowledgebase built directly into our billing panel. We quickly realized after using it for a while that it just wasn't going to work, and so, the search began.

After some extensive planning we settled on Documentation software instead. **The changes were immaculate.**

It is now so much easier to reference articles, create articles, and import images, embeds, and icons. Everything looks much more consistent and stylized. This truly is the new home of Asteroid Host's knowledgebase going forward.

### New Blog
You may have also noticed the introduction of Blog posts. This is where we will post more detailed explanations of updates and current events. Don't worry, anything important will still be notified in the [<icon icon="fa-brands fa-discord" size="lg" /> Discord](https://discord.gg/ZTGMcfsskN).
