# Console

In **the middle** on the main server page, is your server's console/terminal. The console contains logs from sources such as;
- Players connecting/disconnecting
- Server startup information
- Plugin errors
- etc.

---

### Command Box
```
Â» Type a command...
```

Below the terminal is the box where you can type commands. These commands run with the highest permissions and in game the executor is "CONSOLE".

**Example:** Running `ban Hacker 30d Cheating` would look like:
```
> Hacker has been banned for 30 days by CONSOLE for Cheating.
```

### Power Buttons

On the right are the power control buttons.

**Start**
- Simply starts your server when it is offline.

**Restart**
- If your server is offline, the server will start as if you pressed start.
- If your server is online, it will shutdown and turn back on again immediately after.

**Stop**
- Simple stops your server safely if it is running.

**Kill**
- Forcibly closes your server immediately.
- Think of this like Ending a task in Task Manager.
- Only use this if your server is not responding to the **Stop** command.
- This could cause rollbacks or corruption.
