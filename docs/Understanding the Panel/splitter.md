## Splitting the Server

:::danger Important!
Make sure to make your primary server the Bungeecord Proxy as it has port 25565! This can be manually reassigned via a ticket if need be.
:::

### Step 1 - Navigation
1. Head on over to our Game Panel by clicking [HERE](https://panel.asteroidhost.com).
2. Click "Manage Server" on your main server split.
3. Click on the "Split" tab. You may have to slide the horizontal scroller over a bit for it to show up.
4. Click on the blue `SPLIT` button.

### Step 2 - Creating the Split
Below each value box it will show you how much you have available of each.

* For CPU, 100% is equal to one thread.
* For RAM, you should generally follow the binary standard.
  * Take the amount of GB you want, and multiply it by `1024`.
  * Ex: `4GB` would be `4096MB`, or `0.5GB` would be `512MB`.
* Disk should be input the same as memory, following the binary standard.
* In most cases, do not worry about swap.
* Server Name is simply what shows up on the panel. It is not public.
* Click on the sub-users tick if you want to copy your pre-existing sub users over to the new split.

Once everything is filled out, click `SPLIT THIS SERVER`.

Refresh the page, and your split should show up. If you go back to your server list, your new server will be there.

Keep in mind that the split server follows the same egg configuration as the server it was split from. Contact support if you need this changed.
