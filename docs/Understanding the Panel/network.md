## Adding a New Port
If you have additional ports available, you can navigate to the "Network" tab in the panel. Click on "CREATE ALLOCATION" and a new port will be created for you automatically.


## Assigning a Primary Port
Once multiple ports are created and available, a "MAKE PRIMARY" button will show up next to your additional allocations. Click on one and restart your server to apply the changes.


## How to claim a specific port
If you purchased a dedicated IP, or one came with your instance, you are eligible to request a specific port. Just make a ticket through the [Billing Portal](https://billing.asteroidhost.com/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=4) or on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ZTGMcfsskN) and ask our Staff to create one for you.


## Removing a Port
Navigate to the "Network" tab in the panel, and click on the <icon icon="fa-solid fa-trash-can" size="lg" /> Delete icon for the port you would like to remove. If this is a custom port, it will have to be re-added manually again.
