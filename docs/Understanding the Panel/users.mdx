## Adding a New User

### Step 1
Head over to our panel at [panel.asteroidhost.com](https://panel.asteroidhost.com).

### Step 2
Next click on your server you would like to change, and navigate to the "Users" tab.

### Step 3
Click on the "NEW USER" button.

### Step 4
Below are the permissions that you can assign to this user. Make sure you understand what a permission does before you assign it. This can take a while, so [below](#permissions) are some general templates you can go off of for the specified roles of the new user.

### Step 5
After you are done selecting permissions, scroll all the way down to the bottom and click “Invite User”. The user will then get an email in the inbox specified from before. It will tell them that they have been invited to your server, and will ask them to create a password. After following the email’s instructions, they will be able to access your server’s panel with the permissions assigned to them. Rinse and repeat for the rest of the users you would like to add. 

## Permissions
Generally, you shouldn’t grant the following permissions:
- User Deletion
- User Update
- Backup Delete
- Backup Restore
- Allocation Delete
- Database Delete
- Reinstall Server
- Delete Split

You can add these, however make sure it’s only with people you trust. These could easily overwrite any files and lead to data loss or unwanted malfunctions if used incorrectly.


## Modifying a User

In the event that you wish to change a user's permissions, head over to the User tab on the panel and click the <icon icon="fa-solid fa-pencil" size="lg" /> icon. Here you can select which permissions they have. Make sure to click the SAVE button at the top *(or bottom!)* before leaving.


## Removing a User
If you wish to remove a user's permissions entirely, head over to the User tab on the panel and click the <icon icon="fa-solid fa-trash-can" size="lg" /> icon. Make sure you want to remove them, then click "YES, REMOVE SUBUSER". This will not remove their account from our system, but it will remove them from your server.
