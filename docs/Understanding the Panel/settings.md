The ninth tab on the top navigation bar. It is where your SFTP details are located.

## SFTP Information
This box provides you with the login details for connecting to the server's file system through SFTP.

This is used in the [import guide for FileZilla](/Minecraft%20Servers/import-filezilla).


## Server Name & Description
Here you can set the name that your server has on the panel, as well as a quick description. All of this is not public and your players cannot see it.

If you use tickets often, it may be useful to change your server's name from default for us to quickly identify your server. <icon icon="fa-solid fa-heart" size="lg" />


## Server Importer
This is currently non-functional. Refer to [this](/server-import) guide instead.


## Node Information
The Debug Information provides you with info on which Node your Server is on in our Network, as well as your Server Identifier.

Staff will most likely ask for your Server ID before adjusting any server settings.

The Node ID is important for knowing if you are or will be affected in a system outage or for a scheduled maintenance.
