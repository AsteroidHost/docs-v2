# ðŸŒŽ Migrating Hosts
This guide will show you how to move your server to our host!

:::info
This guide assumes you have FileZilla installed already. If you need help with that, click [here](/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions/filezilla).

## Legend
For this guide we will be referring to your original server as **Origin**, and your Asteroid Server as **Asteroid**.

## Step 1 - Retrieving Origin's Connection Info
### Step 1a - Panel Type
 Log into your server's panel. Most of the time it will either be based on Multicraft or Pterodactyl. It is important to know what version your panel is running so you know where to retrieve the connection information.  If you already have your connection info, skip to Step 

If your control panel looks similar to the pictures below, it is using the **Pterodactyl** Layout.

### Step 1b - Pterodactyl

If your Panel is based on Pterodactyl, it most likely uses SFTP. You can usually find your SFTP connection details under the "Settings" tab.

Open notepad and write down the `HOST`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, and `PORT`. The protocol should be SFTP.


### Step 1c - Multicraft

If your Panel is based on Multicraft, it most likely uses FTP. You can usually find your FTP connection details under the "> Files", then "FTP File Access" tab.

Open notepad and write down the `HOST`, `FTP USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, and `PORT`. The protocol should be FTP.

On **PebbleHost**, this FTP Information button is found within the `File Manager`.

## Step 2 - Connecting to Origin

1. Open FileZilla.
2. Copy and paste your saved information you just gathered into the boxes at the top. `HOST`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, and `PORT`.
3. If your `HOST` starts with `SFTP://` or `FTP://` you should be able to leave the port blank.
4. Click "Quickconnect". If any extra boxes pop up asking about Fingerprinting, just click "OK".

You should now be able to see your files on the right.


## Step 3 - Downloading from Origin

:::info
If your server is relatively small, or you are nearing your storage limit on Origin's host, you should copy your files in their current state. However, in most cases it would be better to open Origin's web panel, navigate to the File Manager, and create an archive. (.zip or .tar.gz).

This process requires downloading your server and reuploading it to the new server. If you don't have adequate storage or internet, reach out to us via ticket and we'll move it for you.
:::

On the left is your computer's file directories. By default you are in your Home folder. Right click in the box (not on a folder), and click "Create Directory and enter it". Name is "ServerTransfer".

Then, click back on the right-side window, and either find your archive file, or select everything in the folder and drag it into the left box. This will start downloading your server files to your computer.


## Step 4 - Connecting to Asteroid

1. Click [HERE](https://panel.asteroidhost.com) to open our Game Panel.
2. Click "Manage Server" on the Server you would like to transfer to.
3. At the top, click on "Settings".
4. Open notepad and write down the `SERVER ADDRESS`, and the `USERNAME`.
* You can also click on the boxes to copy.

Now, open FileZilla and in the same boxes at the top as before, enter `SERVER ADDRESS` into `HOST`, and `USERNAME` into `USERNAME`.

The `PASSWORD` is your **Panel**'s Password. (Not your billing password!).

The `PORT` box can either be left blank or set to 2022.

**!!** A box will pop up saying you are already connected. You can either connect via a new tab, or disconnect from Origin and connect to Asteroid. You shouldn't need Origin any more so it is your choice.


## Step 5 - Uploading to Asteroid

:::caution
If your Asteroid Server is running, make sure to stop it first in the "Console" tab on the panel.

If there are any files on your Asteroid Server, be sure to remove them before uploading. Make sure ahead of time none of them are important to you.
:::

We will now be doing the inverse of what we did before. Select everything from the left window and drag them to the right into your Server's root directory. You can view progress at the bottom. This may take a while.

## Step 6 - Finishing Up

Once the transfer is complete, you should now go back to Asteroid Panel, and click on "Files". Scroll down and copy the name of your server JAR. Once copied, go to the "Startup" tab and paste it into the `SERVER JAR FILE` box.

Now you should be able to go to the "Console" tab and start your server. Some plugin configs may need to be changed to accomodate for the IP change.

If you would like to remove your old host's branding, like the server icon, you can remove or replace it by deleting the `server-icon.png` file in the main directory. Click [HERE](/Frequently%20Asked%20Questions/server-icon) to find out more on how to upload your own!
