# Why Asteroid?
Here we will be outlining our hardware choices and why we chose them. You can also view a list of our updated hardware [here](https://asteroidhost.com/company/hardware).

## CPU
In this section, we will be detailing our picks for Minecraft w/ Friends and Server Splitter respectably.
### Minecraft w/ Friends

**CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X**

This is a very good processor considering its budget use case. At this point, it is a few generations old, but stacking up against the competition, it blows everything else out of the water.

### Server Splitter

**CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5900X**

This CPU is the next generation over our w/ Friends plans. The generational improvement that AMD made is insane. It's not the latest generation, but it is still very capable and holds up against the competition nicely for the price.

We understand and show that there are more performant options out there, but we wanted to balance the line between price and performance. Plus, the difference between the 5900X and the 5950X is more cores, which doesn't matter much to the end user since their threads are dedicated anyways so overselling isn't an issue.
