### Interface/Type
Any hosting company taking themselves seriously should be using a wired connection, however in the event that one isn't- get off that provider immediately.

**RJ-45 Ethernet vs WiFi**

It is really important that you have a wired network. WiFi not only factors in a bunch of latency but it can also be easily interrupted or dropped.


### Speed
Around the Server Space you will find anywhere from 100Mbps to 10Gbps. For Minecraft, it doesn't really matter all that much, however if you are planning on having a large server you should be getting 500Mbps or higher.

We at Asteroid Host boast 1Gbps so that any updates or File Transfers won't be an issue on our end.

### DDoS Protection
DDoS Protection is really important for any Minecraft Server. If you plan on maintaining a large public server you should really be backed by 200Gbps or more. Large datacenters, where a majority of hosting companies rent from, offer fantastic DDoS Protection into the Tbps.

A lot of hosts, especially if you buy a VPS instead, will only be around 20Gbps to 40Gbps. This really isn't enough to stay safe and could easily cause problems down the line.

If your hosting company doesn't offer great DDoS Protection, but you want to stay with them, you can try paid, third party services such as [TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com/) or [Infinity-Filter](https://www.infinity-filter.com/).

We at Asteroid Host offer 100Gbps for free on all plans. We also have guides for how to set up both TCPShield and Infinity-Filter on your Server.
