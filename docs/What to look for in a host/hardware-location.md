### Location
If you are making a public server, aim for somewhere centralized. For example Dallas or Chicago in the United States. This will make sure that nobody has a terrible connection. *(Like connecting to LA from Florida)*

If you are hosting for just you and some friends, pick somewhere nearby. Or, pick somewhere between you and your friends. This will give everyone the best ping possible.


### Ping
Ping is a variation of noticeabale lag. It's often synonomous with the phrase "rubber-banding". It is displayed in the form of ms, or the time it takes for packets to be sent back and forth between your router and the server. Here's a good rule of thumb of what latencies are expected:

- Less than 10ms — Exceptional
- Between 10ms and 30ms — Very good
- Between 30ms and 60ms — Good
- Between 60ms and 90ms — Okay
- Between 90ms and 120ms — Poor
- Above 120ms — Noticeable lag
- Above 240ms — Almost unplayable
- Above 500ms — Unplayable

*(Lower is better)*
