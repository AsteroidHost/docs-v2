This guide will show you how to log into our demo panel!

:::info
The server attached to this account is entirely non-functional. Attempting to start the server will fail due to an incorrectly named JAR file. That is intentional for this case, but your server will work just fine. 👍

This is not a 1:1 experience. Some features are missing and others may be limited. This is not the case when you buy a server.

## Logging in

Navigate to our game panel as usual. You can find that [here](https://panel.asteroidhost.com).

Next, log in using the following credentials:
* Username: `demo`
* Password: `demo`

Now, click on `Manage Server`.

You will now be interfacing with the demo server!
