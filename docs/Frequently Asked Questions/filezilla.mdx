This guide will show you how to install FileZilla on your computer.

## Step 1 - Downloading the Installer

We can start by navigating to [filezilla-project.org](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php). This is the official website of the FileZilla project, and any others should be ignored.

It should automatically detect what operating system you are running and give you the correct download button. Click on the big green "Download FileZilla Client" button.

In the popup, click "Download" on the left-most column. It should now start downloading the `.exe`.

## Step 2 - Running the Installer

Once downloaded, open the `.exe`. If it asks for permissions, say `YES`.

Read through the license agreement, then click `I Agree`.

:::danger Warning
FileZilla's setup contains ads. Make sure to click `DECLINE` on all of them as to not install any unwanted software.

## Step 3 - Opening FileZilla
Once completed, click "Finish".

You should now be able to search FileZilla on your computer and open it!
