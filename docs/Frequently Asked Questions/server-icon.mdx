# Custom Server Icon
This guide will show you how to upload your own custom server icon!

---

## Step 1 - Selecting an Image
This step is actually really important for making sure our icon looks nice. Here's some quick tips:

* Try to pick an image with as few colors as possible.
* Try to be sure that it looks good on a dark background such as the default dirt background, or pure black.
* Drop shadows must be very pronounced. As this size, most will either disappear or be unnoticeabale.

Once you have picked a good image, move onto step 2.

## Step 2 - Resizing Our Image
Minecraft Server Icons MUST be a `64x64` `.png` image. Other plugins may find a way around this, but this tutorial is for the Vanilla method.

To do this, we recommend the site, [ImageResizer.com](https://imageresizer.com/).

Select your image or drag and drop it into the box.

### Step 2a - Cropping

If your image is not a perfect square, head over to the `CROP` tab first.

1. Click on `ASPECT RATIO: FREEFORM` and change it to `1:1 SQUARE`.
2. In the preview, resize and drag the box around to be the right crop.
3. Once satisfied, click `CROP` at the bottom.
4. Now, go back to the `RESIZE` tab at the top.


## Step 3 - Getting the right dimensions
Now that our image is a 1:1 Square, change the width box to 64, and the height box should change to 64 automatically.

Now under the `SAVE IMAGE AS` box, click and change it to `PNG`.

Now click `RESIZE IMAGE`.

Once it is done downloading, simply click <icon icon="fa-solid fa-download" size="lg" /> Download Image.

## Step 4 - Upload our Image

1. Navigate to your Server via our [Panel](https://panel.asteroidhost.com).
2. Click "Manage Server" on your server.
3. Click "Files".
4. Click "UPLOAD".
5. Find and upload your resized image you just downloaded.
6. When it is done, scroll down and find it in the server directory.
7. To the right, click on the  <icon icon="fa-solid fa-ellipsis" size="lg" /> meatball menu, *(or right-click)*, and click "<icon icon="fa-solid fa-pencil" size="lg" /> Rename".
8. Change its name to `server-icon.png`, and press enter.
9. Restart your Server.

You should now have a custom server icon! Congratulations!
