# I need more Ports!
If you find yourself needing an additional port, you can do so pretty easily.

---

## Generating a new random port.
Head over to your server @ [panel.asteroidhost.com](https://panel.asteroidhost.com) and click on the Network tab.

If you have more allocations, you can simply click **CREATE ALLOCATION** and one will be added for you.

## Generating a specific port.
If you purchased a Dedicated IP ($3/mo), a specific port can be opened for you. We reserve the following ports for dedicated IP clients:
- Java Default (25565)
- [Dynamp](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap%C2%AE.274/) (8123)
- [Plan](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plan-player-analytics.32536/) (8804)
- [Votifier](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/votifier) (8192)
- [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/) (19132)

Just make a ticket with our support team and we will happily open the port for you.

**Think we should add more to this list? ** Reach out to us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rdDaUW3Wt6)!

**Note:** If you have __any__ Server Splitter plan, you can open any port you want. It will be available.
