## The Cause
Your server used too much memory. This is usually due to a problem with the startup flags within the panel.


## The Fix
This isn't a problem on Asteroid Servers, as we don't have OOM *(Out of Memory Killer)* enabled on our Nodes. If you are experiencing an unresponsive server, [check here](/Troubleshooting/lowcpu).


## The Alternative
If you are using a Server Host that doesn't allow you to edit startup flags, or their panel isn't based on Pterodactyl; you could either optimize your server to use less memory, or consider upgrading your plan.
