# Server Unresponsive
Power Commands don't work and CPU usage is less than 1%.

---

## The Cause
Your server used too much memory, and the OOM *(Out of Memory Killer)* isn't enabled for your instance. This is usually due to a problem with the startup flags within the panel.


## The Fix
This shouldn't be a problem on Asteroid Servers. We tested our startup flags repeatedly, however, if this does happen please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/rdDaUW3Wt6) and we will adjust your flags for you. 


## The Alternative
If you are using a Server Host that doesn't allow you to edit startup flags, you could either optimize your server to use less memory, or consider upgrading your plan.
