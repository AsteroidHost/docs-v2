# Creating a Database
This guide will take only a few minutes to complete.

---

## Step 1
Head over to our panel at [panel.asteroidhost.com](https://panel.asteroidhost.com).

## Step 2
Next click on your server you would like to change, and navigate to the "Databases" tab.

## Step 3
Click on `NEW DATABASE`.

## Step 4
Give your database an identifier under "Database Name".

If you have an IP that you want to be the only connection allowed to access the database, put it in "Connections From". If that didn't make sense, or you don't have one, leave it on `%`.

## Step 5

Now your database name is on the left.

If you click on the eye button, it will show the rest of the connection information.

**Note:** If you are connecting a plugin on the same server as the database, you can use "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" or "0.0.0.0" as the connection IP in your plugin configuration.
